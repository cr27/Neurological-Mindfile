# Mindfile
Currently a file that is composed of Mindbytes, the neurogenomic mindbyte, the personality mindbyte, the neuroimaging mindbyte, the neurotranscriptome mindbyte, the neuroproteome mindbyte, and the neurometabolism mindbyte. The mindfile is mainly a postgresql database hosted on the cloud. The mindfile is representative of an individual's neurological identity. This is a prototype.

# MindByte
Essentially meaningless, messy data. However, over time a program running behind the scenes can sort out a user’s mind byte information.  Mindbytes merge together to form something like a mind file, a file containing a user’s neurological identity.



# NeuroimagingMindByte
Neuroimaging data composed of MRI image(s) stored on desktop. This is a prototype.

# PersonalityMindByte
Accumulates classical psychometric data through personality assesment. The Big Five Personality Trait Assesment and Fisher Tempermant Inventory are used. Either or both of these assesments serve as examplarary prototypical measurement to associate psychology with neurological identity. For now, just the Big Five Personality Trait Assesment is used to create the PersonalityMindByte. Both of the programs have scores output to the console which are converted to .txt and .csv files. The PersonalityMindByte is used to create part of the mindfile. This is a prototype.

Note: Please read codebook.txt to interpret personality data.

# NeurogenomeMindByte
 The genome mind byte below is a Cerebral Cortex Neurogenome. This genome serves as a reference genome for the neurotranscriptome, neurometabolome and neuroproteome mind bytes.

# NeuroproteomeMindByte
The following is an exact description from the proteinatlas website, "The function of the brain, defined as the central nervous system, is to receive, process and execute the coordinated higher functions of perception, motion and cognition that signify human life. The brain can grossly be divided into different neuroanatomical functional regions such as the frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital lobes and central gray matter structures. The brain can further be stratified into neuron rich grey matter and myelinated white matter. The cellular components of the underlying and highly complex network of transmitted signals include neurons and supportive glial cells. The transcriptome analysis shows that 74% (n=14518) of all human proteins (n=19613) are expressed in the brain and 1460 of these genes show an elevated expression in brain compared to other tissue types. An analysis of the genes with elevated expression in the brain show various patterns of expression in different neurons and glial cells, as well as in neuropil; the meshwork of axons, dendrites, synapses and extra cellular matrix that embed the central nervous system cells."

# Installation
### Prerequisites
Winzip

* Winzip, this nifty program helps unzip those .tsv files, .gz files, and .tar files derived from webpages being used to gather and accumulate data.

RStudio

* RStudio is useful for converting non csv files into csv files

Microsoft Excel

* Use Excel to edit/maintain .csv files for sqlizer

http://sqlizer.io/

* Use sqlizer to convert .csv files into MySQL scripts for PostgreSQL

Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL

* Create a PostgreSQL database using Amazon's RDS 

PgAdmin4

* Install PgAdmin4 to gain access to the PostgreSQL Tool that will allow you to add MySQL scripts using the query tool

Netbeans IDE 8.2

* Install Netbeans or any Java platform to connect to the PostgreSQL database

# Usage
Open up Pgadmin4, prepare yourself by getting your postgresql database server name, database master password, and master username. Once these items have been readied right click on where it says servers, from here right click on servers, highlight create and select the  server option. Once you've done this a menu window will appear. You now need to name your server aws-rds or whatever you would like your server name to be.

Next, open up the connection tab that is attached to the window that is or still should be open. Change the host name to the url found under endpoint on the rds webpage. Change the maintainence database to the name of postgres. Then, insert rds database password which is the masterpassword that was created. Then, change the maintainence database to the name of you amazon postgresql database master username.

A new server should now be created with a postgres database attached.
