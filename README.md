# Mindfile
Currently a file that is composed of 5/5 Mindbytes, the neurogenomic mindbyte, the personality mindbyte, the neuroimaging mindbyte, the neurotranscriptome mindbyte, and the neuroproteome mindbyte. The mindfile is a postgresql database hosted on the cloud. The mindfile is representative of an individual's neurological identity. This is a prototype.

# MindByte
Essentially meaningless, messy data, extrapolated from various brain data. However, over time a machine learning or graphy theory based program running behind the scenes can sort out a user’s mind byte information.  Mindbytes merge together to form something like a mind file, a file containing a user’s neurological identity.



# NeuroimagingMindByte
Accumulates Neuroimaging data using the mne python tools which provide both MEG and EEG images, and also accumulates Neuroimaging data using MRI images contained in the neurohacking data file provided by the Neurohacking in R coursera course. The Neurological based images generated by both Python and R can be converted to .jpg files and then analyzed by a artificial neural network in python. For now, these analyzed images 
represent the neuroimaging mindbyte. This is a prototype.

# PersonalityMindByte
Accumulates classical psychometric data through personality assesment. The Big Five Personality Trait Assesment and Fisher Tempermant Inventory
are used. Either or both of these assesments serve as examplarary prototypical measurement to associate psychology with neurological identity. For now, just the Big Five Personality Trait Assesment is used to create the PersonalityMindByte. Both of the programs have scores output to the console which are converted to .txt and .csv files. The PersonalityMindByte is used to create part of the mindfile. This is a prototype.

# NeurogenomeMindByte
 The genome mind byte below is a Cerebral Cortex Neurogenome. This genome serves as a reference genome for the neurotranscriptome and neuroproteome mind bytes.

# NeuroproteomeMindByte
The following is an exact description from the proteinatlas website, "The function of the brain, defined as the central nervous system, is to receive, process and execute the coordinated higher functions of perception, motion and cognition that signify human life. The brain can grossly be divided into different neuroanatomical functional regions such as the frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital lobes and central gray matter structures. The brain can further be stratified into neuron rich grey matter and myelinated white matter. The cellular components of the underlying and highly complex network of transmitted signals include neurons and supportive glial cells. The transcriptome analysis shows that 74% (n=14518) of all human proteins (n=19613) are expressed in the brain and 1460 of these genes show an elevated expression in brain compared to other tissue types. An analysis of the genes with elevated expression in the brain show various patterns of expression in different neurons and glial cells, as well as in neuropil; the meshwork of axons, dendrites, synapses and extra cellular matrix that embed the central nervous system cells."
